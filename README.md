## _What is OBS-Status_

OBS-Status is a GNOME extension that adds an indicator to the GNOME Top Bar. This indicator shows the Recording, Streaming, and Idle statuses of Open Broadcaster Software (OBS Studio). This project is licensed under the GNU license.

## _Bugs Fixed_

- The Top Bar indicator was not being destroyed when disabling the extension.

## _Features Added_

- An option was added to the extension's preferences to choose whether to display status labels in an abbreviated form. This means the indicator will show "Rec" instead of "Recording".

## _Known Bugs_

- A bug is being worked on that causes the extension to show the "Streaming" status when it is not streaming. This bug mainly occurs when the operating system is first booted up.
